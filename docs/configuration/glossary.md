## Variables

- Words in curly brackets are variables. Example: {variable}.

    ~~~

  - Example: `{variable}`.
- A variable in curly brackets is replaced with its value.
  
  - Example:
    - The value of {variable} is 4.
    - Then,

      ~~~md
      - {{variable}} equals 42.
      - `{{variable}}` equals `42`.
      - ``{{variable}}`` equals ``42``.
      ~~~

- The `{X}`, `{Y}`, `{Z}` variables are numbers that:
  - correspond to team numbers;
  - can take values `12`, `34`, `56`;
  - are pairwise different.
