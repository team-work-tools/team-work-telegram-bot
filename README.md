# Daily Meeting Telegram Bot

A Telegram bot that helps you conduct [daily](https://www.agilealliance.org/glossary/daily-meeting/) (or at least regular) meetings.

## Motivation

- I have participated in too many projects that delivered less than they could have due to a lack of regular work from myself and my teammates.
- I want a bot to remind me that I actually have to work on workdays.
- I want everyone on my team to know each other's workdays.
- In the morning, I don't care enough to ask my teammates about their progress, plans, and problems, so I want a bot to do that for me.
- When I do care later, I can read through my teammates' messages and help them resolve their problems.

## Bot start message

```console
I can help you conduct daily (or at least regular) meetings.

You can control me by sending these commands:

Global commands
/start - Enable me.
/help - Get a help message.

Team settings commands
/set_meetings_time - Set meetings time.

Personal settings commands
/join - Join meetings.
/skip - Skip meetings.

Chat information commands
/get_chat_state - Get the chat state that I store.
```

## Meeting messages

The bot sends messages at meetings time.

```console
@user, what did you do last working day?
```

```console
@user, what will you do today?
```

```console
@user, what (if anything) is blocking your progress?
```
